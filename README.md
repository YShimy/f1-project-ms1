# Formula 1 Podium Prediction — CSEN903 Milestone 1

**Team 120**

For every driver entering a Formula 1 race, predict whether that driver finishes on the
podium (`positionOrder <= 3`), using only information that exists **after qualifying and
before the race starts**. Anything produced by the race itself — finishing position, points,
laps, status, pit stops, post-race standings — is treated as leakage and excluded.

## Contents

| File | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `f1-project-ms1.ipynb` | The run-all notebook: raw-data audit, cleaning, EDA before and after, the three data-engineering questions, feature engineering, the modeling table and leakage checks, three models, experiments, XAI and the inference function. Sections 1–14. |
| `F1_MS1_Report_Team120.pdf` | The analytical report: the same work written up, with every figure and the design decisions behind it. |

## Results in one line

A depth-4 random forest, chosen on the validation seasons, reaches **PR-AUC 0.721 and
ROC-AUC 0.940 on the unseen test seasons (2022–2024)** — about 4.8× the PR-AUC of a random
model at a 15.1% podium rate. Starting position dominates; recent form, championship
position and qualifying speed add smaller, partly overlapping information.

## Data

Formula 1 World Championship 1950–2024 (Kaggle / Ergast):
`rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020`. The CSVs are not committed here.

## Running it

- **On Kaggle (as it was run):** https://www.kaggle.com/code/seifezz11/f1-project-ms1 —
  the dataset above is attached as a notebook input at
  `/kaggle/input/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020/`, then **Run All**.
- **Locally:** download the dataset from Kaggle, then change `PATH` in the first code cell of
  section 1 to the folder holding the CSV files. The notebook needs `pandas`, `numpy`,
  `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, `shap` and `lime`.

The notebook runs top to bottom with no hidden state; random seeds are fixed, so the
statistical models reproduce exactly (the neural network can move by about ±0.01).
